I'm currently a PhD candidate at [Cornell Statistical Signal Processing Laboratory](https://sites.coecis.cornell.edu/ssplab/). I am fortunately to be advised by Prof. [Vikram Krishnamurthy](https://vikram.ece.cornell.edu/). Before joining Cornell, I obtained my BEng (with University Honors) from Tsinghua University. I work on statistical signal processing with an application in social networks and blockchain systems. I have published papers in [IEEE TCSS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6570650), [IEEE TNSE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6488902), and [ICASSP 2021](https://www.2021.ieeeicassp.org/2021.ieeeicassp.org/index.html). 
*Never stop looking for collaboration.*

Research interest: statistical signal processing, graph neural networks, Bayesian nonparametric, stochastic control, and related applications.
